                        <h3>Step 1</h3>
                        <p>Cyber security was the topic area and the audience was broad, meaning that we had some
work to do to ensure we keep all learners engaged, regardless of their technical expertise.</p>

                        <h3>Step 2</h3>
                        <p>Therefore, we used metaphors, animation and lots of visuals to help make the content feel
familiar and easy to understand.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3</h3>
                        <p>Language was key to ensure the course made sense to the learners, enough to make them
feel empowered and understand what their roles and responsibilities were.</p>

                        <h3>Step 4</h3>
                        <p>The outcome was a short eLearning course (circa 25 minutes) which included a 2 minute
video to set the scene, a dive into the history and some case studies to support the
importance. From there we utilised lots of creative visuals to drive the messages.</p>

                <h3>The situation</h3>
                <p>Some topics are easy to transform into an engaging piece of training. But every so often you get a
particularly dry subject which no matter which way you look at the content it will send some people
to sleep.</p>
                <p>Cyber Security was one of those subjects, especially to those who do not share the interest.</p>
                <h3>Prompts for Action</h3>
                <p>Using familiar metaphorical examples made it easier to deliver language which was understood by a
wider audience. It was important to establish stories, the history and case studies to deliver drama
and impact around the issues of cyber Security. At all times referring back to the clientâ€™s business to
make the context relevant and familiar to the employee.</p>
                <p>The element of history should be told through the use of visuals or a moving timeline of events.
Illustrations and characters would be a great way to do this.</p>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <p>It was important not to use complex language for those who do not have a software background but
in the same instance, software developers also needed to be kept engaged and reminded them that
anyone or any business could be a target of a cyber attack.</p>
                <p>The main driver for the course was to empower and drive awareness, surrounding the importance of
how cyber security must be considered within all businesses today. Not only IT businesses, banks
and governments are targets for a cyber attack anymore. It extends much further than this!</p>
                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The outcome was a 25 minute eLearning course, which contained a 2 minute video to set the scene.
There were also animations to expand into the history, which allowed for a deeper dive into the
content. We also created a metaphor which related the different cyber security levels, which
compared to the different devices and security systems you could typically install in your home to
defend against intruders. For this we developed another interaction; a nice isometric house graphic.
This metaphor was used to compare other aspects of cyber security systems later in the course,
which further aided the embedding of knowledge surrounding the subject. All in all a great solution
well liked and highly rated by the learners.</p>
                <h3>Moral</h3>
                <p>The key to understanding a complex or unfamiliar topic is simplicity or familiarity of a topic close to
home. In this case, literally your home. For Olano, courses that drive awareness and empowerment
are a great opportunity to show what we can do to fully engage the audience, regardless of how dry
the subject area may be.</p>
