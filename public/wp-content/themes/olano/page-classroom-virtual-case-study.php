                <h3>The situation</h3>
                <p>Partnering with the Economics of Mutuality, the project was to create a knowledge hub for a major
manufacturing business to empower and promote the benefits of a route-to-market for vulnerable
communities. Giving benefits to the communities from both a social and economic aspect which
could also benefit the supply lines for larger businesses.</p>
                <p>EoM have masses of knowledge for the market which feeds in as content for the project. This wealth
of information needed to be developed into something engaging and presented in a professional
way which was, in part interactive and bitesize. Meanwhile, everything would also remain editable
by the client for future updates.</p>
                <h3>Prompts for Action</h3>
                <p>Initially solution options were presented as well as mock-ups of the design. We then began the
journey of developing the content as it was created by the subject matter expects.</p>
                <p>We had elected jointly with our EoM partners to create a professionally designed SharePoint site
which hosted a multitude of different editable materials, all linked together through some bitesize
interactive presentations.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, there would a survey, videos and infographics which made the reader feel more
involved and offered many opportunities to delve in further or progress in a non-linear fashion.</p>
                <h3>Consequences</h3>
                <p>There was a risk that the quantity of content could get monotonous if the slide designs get reused –
therefore a lot of variation on design was required. Because the quantity of raw content was in
excess of 300 slides and the timeline to develop was short, there would be a battle between
efficiency and creativity of design’. Therefore, more of the team would be needed to work on the
project and a lead designer would need to be elected to keep a consistent design style across all
material developed.</p>
                <p>Keeping content editable is difficult when you need to be creative and being over creative with slides
will make it difficult for the average user to update the slides.</p>
                <h3>Outcomes</h3>
                <p>The outcome was a tailored SharePoint site which felt like a nicely designed website. Containing a
homepage that clearly signposted to the subpages within the site. The bitesize modules within the
site signposted to pages which hosted document viewer. This gives the viewer a fluid way of reading
content from different sources without the need to click to download or open separate applications.
Everything feels seamlessly connected with areas of interaction, references to outside sources of
information, videos and downloadable documents and templates. All helps to equip and empower
the reader with everything they need to begin developing within the target community.</p>
                <p>It was all consistently branded and with a vast amount different slide styles which keeps the reader
absorbed. Version control and file protection was all setup along with permission groups to give
specific owners the responsibility to update files.</p>
                <h3>Moral</h3>
                <p>The battle against death-by-PowerPoint was won. But not only with nicely designed slides;
interactive slides, breaking up the content into sections, utilising menu systems and linking to other
parts of the site to encourage a non-linear flow.</p>
                <p>A great solution should not be limited by its modality. SharePoint can be very limiting with its
options for design, especially if you have restricted access to change features. But thinking outside
the box to implement externally designed assets which all come together in perfect harmony.</p>
